        <h1>A simple writeup on myself.</h1>
        <p>My name is Nwafor Blessing. I am in my early twenties. I am fair in complexion.
            <br>I am currently a student of the Federal University of Technology,Owerri studying Biochemistry. Biochemistry is a such a beautiful course. 
            When I first started this course, I couldn't see the usefulness. I thought it was just a waste of my time but now I really appreciate the course.
            <br>I will talk about this course in the later aspect of this writeup.

                <h3>My Academics</h3>
                <p>I am currently a final student studying Biochemistry in FUTO. Like I said earlier on, Biochemistry is a really interesting course. It studies the chemical reactions in a living organism.
                    <br>Studying biochemistry has really been an eye opener for me and it has taught me new things and dispelled some myths that I thought were true.
                    It has taught me various things and I really hope to be a professional in this field. There are different aspects in this field and they include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Medical Biochemistry</li>
                        <li>Forensic Biochemistry</li>
                        <li>Industrial Biochemistry</li>
                        <li>Pharmaceutical Biochemistry</li>
                        <li>Agricultural Biochemistry</li>
                        <li>Toxicology</li>
                        <li>Nutritional Biochemistry</li>
                    </ol>
